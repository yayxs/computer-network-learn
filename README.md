### in `MDN`

>**HTTP** is a [protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/protocol) which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.
